# Car-Price-Prediction
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning involves building a model that estimates the price of a car based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, and more. The goal is to create a system that predicts the price based on historical data.

# OVERVIEW
A Car Price Prediction system using Machine Learning aims to estimate the price of a car based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, and fuel type. By analyzing historical car data, the model learns patterns between these features and prices. Key steps include data collection, preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling), and applying machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest. The system is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess accuracy. Such models provide accurate price estimates, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the car market.

# DATASET
A dataset with fields like name, company, year, price, kms_driven, and fuel_type is typically used for tasks such as car price prediction, where each entry represents a car listing with its relevant attributes.

# VISUALISATION
Visualizing the dataset involves representing relation between price and name through boxplot

# MODEL
A Linear Regression model is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is assumed to be linear.

# MODEL PERFOMANCE
A model performance graph typically includes plots like the accuracy/loss curve, which shows how the model's accuracy and error evolve over training epochs for both training and validation sets, helping detect overfitting.
